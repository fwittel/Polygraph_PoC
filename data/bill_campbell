<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 97 &middot; Location 1169</div><div class='noteText'>And when he was finished asking questions and listening , and busting your butt , he usually would not tell you what to do .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 97 &middot; Location 1171</div><div class='noteText'>Don’t tell people what to do , tell them stories about why they are doing it .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 100 &middot; Location 1204</div><div class='noteText'>Bill’s perspective was that it’s a manager’s job to push the team to be more courageous . Courage is hard . People are naturally afraid of taking risks for fear of failure . It’s the manager’s job to push them past their reticence .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 105 &middot; Location 1257</div><div class='noteText'>Bill helped her past that . “ He encouraged me to dress however I felt most comfortable , because people can tell when you’re not being yourself , ” she says . “ Then they try to figure out why not , and that breeds distrust . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 105 &middot; Location 1264</div><div class='noteText'>He started by building trust , which only deepened over time . He was highly selective in choosing his coachees ; he would only coach the coachable , the humble , hungry lifelong learners . He listened intently , without distraction . He usually didn’t tell you what to do ; rather , he shared stories and let you draw conclusions . He gave , and demanded , complete candor . And he was an evangelist for courage , by showing inordinate confidence and setting aspirations high .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 109 &middot; Location 1297</div><div class='noteText'>Bill Campbell was a coach of teams . He built them , shaped them , put the right players in the right positions ( and removed the wrong players from the wrong positions ) , cheered them on , and kicked them in their collective butt when they were underperforming .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 109 &middot; Location 1299</div><div class='noteText'>He knew , as he often said , that “ you can’t get anything done without a team . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 110 &middot; Location 1303</div><div class='noteText'>Bill’s guiding principle was that the team is paramount , and the most important thing he looked for and expected in people was a “ team - first ” attitude .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 111 &middot; Location 1319</div><div class='noteText'>But in teams , and particularly high - performing teams , other things matter , too . It’s not just about money ! Purpose , pride , ambition , ego : these are vital motivators as well and must be considered by any manager or coach .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 112 &middot; Location 1332</div><div class='noteText'>So why should executive teams , which consist of presumably the most talented people in the company , need a coach ? “ It was bizarre to me when I first joined the company , ” Patrick Pichette says . “ You have all these amazing people at Google . Why would they need a coach ? ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 113 &middot; Location 1348</div><div class='noteText'>As managers , we tend to focus on the problem at hand . What is the situation ? What are the issues ? What are the options ? And so on . These are valid questions , but the coach’s instinct is to lead with a more fundamental one . Who was working on the problem ? Was the right team in place ? Did they have what they needed to succeed ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 116 &middot; Location 1379</div><div class='noteText'>Bill looked for four characteristics in people . The person has to be smart , not necessarily academically but more from the standpoint of being able to get up to speed quickly in different areas and then make connections . Bill called this the ability to make “ far analogies . ” The person has to work hard , and has to have high integrity . Finally , the person should have that hard - to - define characteristic : grit . The ability to get knocked down and have the passion and perseverance to get up and go at it again .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 117 &middot; Location 1388</div><div class='noteText'>A big turnoff for Bill was if they were no longer learning . Do they have more answers than questions ? That’s a bad sign !</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 119 &middot; Location 1416</div><div class='noteText'>The most effective coaches tolerate and even encourage some level of eccentricity and “ prickliness ” among their team members .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 120 &middot; Location 1423</div><div class='noteText'>“ It’s not what you used to do , it’s not what you think , it’s what you do every day . ” This is perhaps the most important characteristic Bill looked for in his players : people who show up , work hard , and have an impact every day . Doers .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 122 &middot; Location 1455</div><div class='noteText'>“ because when Campbell ran a meeting or brought a group together , the environment was results oriented , everyone participated and contributed , and they actually enjoyed the meeting .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 123 &middot; Location 1462</div><div class='noteText'>An important , often overlooked , aspect of team building is developing relationships within the team .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 123 &middot; Location 1463</div><div class='noteText'>So Bill looked for any opportunity to pair people up .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 124 &middot; Location 1470</div><div class='noteText'>Jonathan stopped dictating and started pairing people up . The results : better decisions , stronger team .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 132 &middot; Location 1570</div><div class='noteText'>Bill’s approach , Shona says , was always to tackle the hardest problem first . “ You have to address that first . ”</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 133 &middot; Location 1574</div><div class='noteText'>When you hear people saying that things are getting “ political , ” that often means that problems have arisen because the data or process hasn’t led to the best decision .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 136 &middot; Location 1612</div><div class='noteText'>One way Bill was able to accomplish this trick was by staying relentlessly positive . Negative situations can be infectious , people get cynical , optimism fades .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 136 &middot; Location 1614</div><div class='noteText'>“ but Bill was by far the most positive board member we had . ” It would be easy to dismiss this attitude as mere cheerleading , except that he was also relentless in identifying and addressing problems , which cheerleaders don’t do .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 144 &middot; Location 1708</div><div class='noteText'>Bill walked into the room . “ I love you guys , ” he said . “ There’s something that’s really bothering me .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 145 &middot; Location 1723</div><div class='noteText'>As Bill described it , his job as our coach was to “ see little flaws in the organization that with a little massage we can make better .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 146 &middot; Location 1728</div><div class='noteText'>This is the power of coaching in general : the ability to offer a different perspective , one unaffected by being “ in the game . ” ( Patrick Pichette : “ Bill saw all the chess pieces all the time , because he had the luxury of not being on the board . ” )</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 149 &middot; Location 1772</div><div class='noteText'>This was all done without an agenda .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 149 &middot; Location 1773</div><div class='noteText'>When he sensed those moments , he’d work behind the scenes , drawing out people’s points of view , closing communication gaps , and fixing miscommunications , so that when the time came to discuss things in the meeting and make the decision , everyone was prepared .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 150 &middot; Location 1785</div><div class='noteText'>But leading teams becomes a lot more joyful when you know and care about people . It’s freeing . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 156 &middot; Location 1825</div><div class='noteText'>The reason Bill was able to get away with his hugs - and - curses approach was that all of his behavior was rooted in his heart : it came from love .</h3>
